Streamline everything from your schedule to your expenses.<\/p><p>Though there's an app for almost everything, the app marketplace is so crowded you might not know which are the best fit for you. Here are 10 apps that will make running a business much, much easier. <\/p><p>1. Evernote. One of the most popular apps on the market, Evernote has evolved way past just classic note-taking. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/\">Evernote<\/a>'s extended family includes <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/penultimate\/\">Penultimate<\/a>, a hand-writing app for taking notes on tablet; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/webclipper\/\">Web Clipper<\/a>, which allows you to clip web pages coupon-style; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/peek\/\">Peek<\/a>, a notecard-like study aid; and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/skitch\/\">Skitch<\/a>, an image mark-up tool. Cost: Free, $5 per month for premium features. Platforms: Android, iOS.<\/p><p>2. Tempo AI. Think of it like a personal assistant for your smartphone. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tempo.ai\/\">Tempo AI<\/a> goes above and beyond the typical paper calendar. It links calendar events to relevant emails and attachments for pending appointments, queues up directions to your next meeting location, and pulls up email and phone info for last-minute coordination with your contacts. Cost: Free. Platforms: iOS.<\/p><p>3. Xero. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xero.com\/\">Xero<\/a> is more than just a Quikbooks lookalike; its an accountant for the cloud. The money-managing web app allows you to link with banks, customers and online payment systems like PayPal--as well as monitor payroll and budgeting software as you grow. Cost: $19 to $39 per month. Platforms: Android, iOS, OS X, Windows.<\/p><p>4. Feedly. Don't worry about Google Reader's impending retirement. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.feedly.com\/\">Feedly<\/a>, a news-aggregator app, compiles the latest articles from your favorite blogs and web publications--plus any podcasts and YouTube channels you subscribe to. (Ahem. Don't forget to add Inc.) Cost: Free. Platforms: Android, iOS or on your web browser.<\/p><p>5. Sleep Cycle. You know those days when a snooze button just isn't enough? <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sleepcycle.com\/\">Sleep Cycle<\/a> helps with that. This alarm clock app uses motion sensors to analyze your sleep patterns, and wakes you up during the lightest phases of sleep. You just pick a half-hour window in which you want to wake up and the app takes over from there. Cost: $0.99. Platforms: iOS.<\/p><p>6. Brewster. What Tempo is to your calendar, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.brewster.com\/\">Brewster<\/a> is to your contact book. This contact-organization app pulls from your various social profiles--and your phone's address book--to compile a comprehensive list of everyone you know. Then, it helps you keep in touch with them. Using a priority ranking system based on your own interactions, Brewster lets you know when you've maintained radio silence for too long. Which lets you balance it all, from reaching out to potential investors or customers...to remembering your grandmother's birthday. Cost: Free. Platforms: Android, iOS.<\/p><p>7. Seatguru. Perhaps this is a familiar scene: You're in a plane 35,000 feet off the ground--and your phone's about to die. In addition to helping you nab the best possible seat on your flight, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.seatguru.com\/\">Seatguru<\/a> solves that pesky outlet problem. The app's detailed plane maps--created by travelers like you--point out mile-high perks, like in-seat outlets and extra leg room, for your specific aircraft. The only thing this app can't predict, it seems, is your seat mate. But then again, it's only in beta. Cost: Free. Platforms: Android, iOS.<\/p><p>8. Wi-Fi Finder. Perhaps even harder than finding an outlet when you need one: Finding a free Wi-Fi. The appropriately titled <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/wi-fi-finder\/id300708497?mt=8\">Wi-Fi Finder<\/a> does exactly that. It provides you with a map of the nearest public Wi-Fi hotspots--so you can rustle up an Internet connection even on the go. Cost: Free. Platforms: Android, iOS.<\/p><p>9. SideCar. If you're still a ride-share skeptic, you may want to consider the perks: Vetted local drivers, faster-than-a-taxi service, and a donation-based payment system. Also, a smaller carbon footprint. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.side.cr\/\">SideCar<\/a> allows you search for drivers, book a ride, and pay for your travel on one app. Cost: Varies. Platforms: Android, iOS.<\/p><p>10. Applause. These days, it seems like there's an app for just about everything--including, as it happens, finding the best apps. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.applause.com\/\">Applause<\/a> is a web app that measures user satisfaction and app quality--helping to connect you with the latest and greatest software tools for all of your devices.

British scientists have measured the impact of email on stress levels and it's not good.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">You know that buzzing, stressed out feeling you get when you look at your overflowing inbox of hear the ping of an arriving message?<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Well, turns out that reaction is real and it isn&rsquo;t just mental; it&rsquo;s physical too.<\/p><p>A team of researchers out of Loughborough University in the UK used a set of 30 government employees as guinea pigs to determine the physical as well as psychological effects of email. To do so they tracked the blood pressure, heart rate and cortisol (a hormone related to stress) levels of the syudy participants, who were also asked to keep a diary of their work days. What they found probably won&rsquo;t surprise you.<\/p><p>Though a single email was no more stressful than receiving a phone call, the amount of email that came at the study subjects throughout the day meant that email ended up being far more stressful than other means of communication. Dealing with all those messages raised cortisol levels as well as increasing blood pressure and heart rate -- all signs of elevated stress. If you need reminding, physical stress like this can lead to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/psychcentral.com\/lib\/2007\/the-physical-effects-of-long-term-stress\/all\/1\/\">a parade of nasty conditions<\/a> like heart troubles and high blood pressure over the long-term.<\/p><p>That email is stressing you out may be scary but satisfying as scientific confirmation of your intuitions. However, perhaps the more useful aspects of the study were finer grain details about exactly what sort of email is the most stressful.

British scientists have measured the impact of email on stress levels and it's not good.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">You know that buzzing, stressed out feeling you get when you look at your overflowing inbox of hear the ping of an arriving message?<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Well, turns out that reaction is real and it isn&rsquo;t just mental; it&rsquo;s physical too.<\/p><p>A team of researchers out of Loughborough University in the UK used a set of 30 government employees as guinea pigs to determine the physical as well as psychological effects of email. To do so they tracked the blood pressure, heart rate and cortisol (a hormone related to stress) levels of the syudy participants, who were also asked to keep a diary of their work days. What they found probably won&rsquo;t surprise you.<\/p><p>Though a single email was no more stressful than receiving a phone call, the amount of email that came at the study subjects throughout the day meant that email ended up being far more stressful than other means of communication. Dealing with all those messages raised cortisol levels as well as increasing blood pressure and heart rate -- all signs of elevated stress. If you need reminding, physical stress like this can lead to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/psychcentral.com\/lib\/2007\/the-physical-effects-of-long-term-stress\/all\/1\/\">a parade of nasty conditions<\/a> like heart troubles and high blood pressure over the long-term.<\/p><p>That email is stressing you out may be scary but satisfying as scientific confirmation of your intuitions. However, perhaps the more useful aspects of the study were finer grain details about exactly what sort of email is the most stressful. Email messages that contain timely information weren&rsquo;t stressful, nor were those that acknowledged or expressed gratification for completed work. The kind of emails that did cause stress levels to spike interrupted tasks in progress or were irrelevant to the receipient.<\/p><p>Again, that&rsquo;s not super surprising.

In a way, it's the crowdsourced answer to Google's current version of Maps.<\/p><p>When news of the deal broke, a few balked at the price tag, chalking up the 10-digit sum to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/google\/10078418\/Google-and-Facebook-1bn-bidding-war-over-Waze-navigation-app.html\">a bidding war<\/a> that escalated between Facebook; or just another acquisition in a frothy start-up market. <\/p><p>But besides the high price tag, the armchair analysis behind the deal tended to focus on a couple of points: That Google was intimidated by Waze, or, as some suggested, buying Waze would keep the company <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/business.time.com\/2013\/06\/10\/heres-why-google-wants-to-buy-waze-a-red-hot-map-app-for-1-billion\/\">out of the hands of Apple or Facebook<\/a>, who are each beginning to build out their own map products. <\/p><p>That's ridiculous. The real reason Waze commanded such a high price tag--and why Google, Apple, and Facebook have been chasing the company--is buried a few paragraphs into <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waze.com\/legal\/privacy\/\">the company's Privacy Policy<\/a>. Read carefully (emphasis ours):<\/p><blockquote><p>The content that you submit is neither private nor confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it...When you use your mobile device with a copy of the Application installed, Waze collects your location and route information. Waze uses that information to provide you and other users with the Services. Waze may make further use of your location and route information by providing you information about sites, shops and other places and attractions in your close vicinity.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There's definitely some logic to the idea that Google wants to enhance its map experience by integrating user-supplied information. But that's not worth $1 billion. <\/p><p>Buying Waze provides Google with access to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/google-expected-acquire-waze-mapping-navigation-app-maker-11b-1297971\">about 45 <\/a>million new user location patterns. That's data that can, by Waze's own admission, be repackaged and sold to third party advertisers--something Google is famously good at. Waze's own Privacy Policy provides some helpful explanation: <\/p><blockquote><p>For example, Waze may record the frequency and scope of your use of the Services, the duration of your sessions, the web pages that you visit, information that you read, content that you use or create, advertisements that you view or click on, your communications with other users and third parties, the Internet protocol (IP) address and the name of the domain that serve you to access the Services, and the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to log-in. Such data is usually automatically collected and stored in log files of the Services' computer servers.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There's a reason Waze is a free download on iOS and Android, and there's a reason Google paid $1 billion to acquire the company: Your location data is extremely valuable to Google. <\/p><p>This isn't news.

In 2012, McKinsey <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/insights\/business_technology\/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation\">reported<\/a> that the market for personal location data would reach $600 billion by 2020. <\/p><p>Frankly, if anyone's concerned here, it's not Apple or Facebook.

            "content:encoded" : "<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/WZBCK_26741.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>Google wants to be the layer of location on the Web, and they're willing to pay $1 billion to get it.<\/p><p>After months of negotiations, it looks like Google will finally be purchasing Waze, the Israeli social mapping site, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/06\/09\/google-is-close-to-acquiring-waze-a-rival-in-maps\/\">for a reported $1 billion. <\/a><\/p><p>In case you're not familiar <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waze.com\/\">with the company<\/a>, Waze is similar to Google Maps, only it uses route suggestions from users to inform other users on the quickest and most efficient way to get from Point A to Point B. In a way, it's the crowdsourced answer to Google's current version of Maps.<\/p><p>When news of the deal broke, a few balked at the price tag, chalking up the 10-digit sum to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/google\/10078418\/Google-and-Facebook-1bn-bidding-war-over-Waze-navigation-app.html\">a bidding war<\/a> that escalated between Facebook; or just another acquisition in a frothy start-up market. <\/p><p>But besides the high price tag, the armchair analysis behind the deal tended to focus on a couple of points: That Google was intimidated by Waze, or, as some suggested, buying Waze would keep the company <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/business.time.com\/2013\/06\/10\/heres-why-google-wants-to-buy-waze-a-red-hot-map-app-for-1-billion\/\">out of the hands of Apple or Facebook<\/a>, who are each beginning to build out their own map products. <\/p><p>That's ridiculous. The real reason Waze commanded such a high price tag--and why Google, Apple, and Facebook have been chasing the company--is buried a few paragraphs into <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.waze.com\/legal\/privacy\/\">the company's Privacy Policy<\/a>. Read carefully (emphasis ours):<\/p><blockquote><p>The content that you submit is neither private nor confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it...When you use your mobile device with a copy of the Application installed, Waze collects your location and route information. Waze uses that information to provide you and other users with the Services. Waze may make further use of your location and route information by providing you information about sites, shops and other places and attractions in your close vicinity.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There's definitely some logic to the idea that Google wants to enhance its map experience by integrating user-supplied information. But that's not worth $1 billion. <\/p><p>Buying Waze provides Google with access to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/google-expected-acquire-waze-mapping-navigation-app-maker-11b-1297971\">about 45 <\/a>million new user location patterns. That's data that can, by Waze's own admission, be repackaged and sold to third party advertisers--something Google is famously good at. Waze's own Privacy Policy provides some helpful explanation: <\/p><blockquote><p>For example, Waze may record the frequency and scope of your use of the Services, the duration of your sessions, the web pages that you visit, information that you read, content that you use or create, advertisements that you view or click on, your communications with other users and third parties, the Internet protocol (IP) address and the name of the domain that serve you to access the Services, and the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to log-in. Such data is usually automatically collected and stored in log files of the Services' computer servers.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>There's a reason Waze is a free download on iOS and Android, and there's a reason Google paid $1 billion to acquire the company: Your location data is extremely valuable to Google. <\/p><p>This isn't news. Back in 2011, Google execs <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748703703304576297450030517830.html\">were e-maling back and forth<\/a> about the value of user location data, strategizing on how to grow the mound of information the company could collect around customers' real-life interactions. \"I cannot stress enough how important Google's Wi-Fi location database is to our Android and mobile-product strategy,\" Google's product manager wrote at the time.

Last week, the company got a green light. Here's how that happened.<\/p><p>Last Thursday, the New York State Court of Appeals lifted a restraining order against e-hailing programs in New York City. That couldn't have been a bigger sigh of relief for Jay Bregman, the co-founder and CEO of Hailo, a taxi-hailing app whose launch has been put on pause multiple times in New York City. <\/p><p>The program has been on hold since last June when State Supreme Court blocked it due to the city seeking the state legislature's approval after the program was rejected by the city council. While the program is not completely in the clear until after the case is debate and the court issues a verdict, it's operating now--and Inc. caught up with Bregman to get a glimpse inside the process.<\/p><p>How does it feel being able to finally operate in New York?  <br \/>First of all we've already been operating in New York since late April ... <\/p><p>In Beta, correct?<br \/>In Beta, right. I am just extremely proud to be a New Yorker and was extremely proud last week to have had a year-long partnership with the [Taxi and Limousine Commission, the agency responsible for regulating taxis and other for-hire vehicles in New York City], who we have been meeting with before we have even launched in London [in 2011]. They've been looking at and observing the growth of our operation as well as that of other networks. And then that developed into pilot program rules which we contributed to their development, and testified on their behalf. What I am the most happy about is that I think we have made the right decision to be the only app provider to legally intervene in the case.<\/p><p>Why do you think that Hailo was the only one to join in on the lawsuit? <br \/>We did it because we wanted to protect the rights of New Yorkers, both of the riding public and of the yellow taxis, to experience the technology that was both inevitable and unyieldingly positive to them in terms of their livelihood as drivers and lives as passengers. We felt we had to intervene on behalf of the New Yorkers, we felt we had to stand up for the truth that only we could tell. The TLC could tell their view from the perspective of a New York City driver, but we could put insight into what the future is and the fact that the technology is loved by the drivers and passengers around the world as well as those in New York. And we felt that was worth fighting for.<\/p><p>Even though the injunction was lifted, the court case is still going forward and will debated even as e-hail is to go forward. Is that accurate?<br \/>Look, let's take it back a stage. This case was frivolous at best to begin with. It was you know basically trying to argue that technology that was proven to be completely safe, that there were no laws against it and it only benefits elsewhere in the world, somehow should be denied to New Yorkers. That point never made sense to me. It was summarily rejected by the justice Carol Huff of the Supreme Court, who threw out the case, so they already lost.<\/p><p>Actually, we have been doing right by what Mayor Bloomberg has told entrepreneurs like us to do, which is invest in New York, hire people in New York, bring technology to new york, and you will be rewarded. This was great victory ultimately for that vision. You know, it required a little bit more work perhaps than just building a network of drivers and passengers, it required going to court fighting for the rights of drivers and the rights of New Yorkers, but then, ultimately we believe passionately in what we do and so we were happy to do that. <\/p><p>Now that you will be transitioning from Beta, what do you expect to happen in New York?<br \/>You know, this network right now ever since the decision, it's been the fastest growing network we have ever seen. And bear in mind, you know, I am sitting in a cab in London where half of all cabs use the app, as do hundred of thousands of passengers. In Dublin, in seven months, one out of every ten people in that city was a Hailo passenger. But, yeah, New York is growing faster than any of those cities did. <\/p><p>What could other start-ups learn from Hailo joining this lawsuit and how you handled this situation?<br \/>Put your principles on the line and go to court defending what you believe. Making it in New York is hard, but so is running a start up. It takes confidence.<\/p>",

Read on to find out which model won his seal of approval.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">I'm a ferocious reader. One of my favorite places to hang out is Barnes & Noble, where I can sip coffee and read the first chapter of new books I'm \"investigating\" for purchase. On business trips, I'll usually read one book on the flight out and one on the flight back.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">E-book readers are especially handy: They are light enough to slip into a laptop bag, yet provide access to millions of books at the touch of the screen. Recently, I decided to test four new models to see which offered the most flexibility, book selection, add-on features (likes movies and music), and the best overall value.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">E-book readers tend to fall into two distinct categories. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B008GFRBBW\/ref=fs_jw\">Kindle Fire HD 8.9<\/a> ($399) and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/p\/nook-hd-plus-barnes-noble\/1110060512\">Barnes & Noble HD+<\/a> ($179) are multi-purpose e-readers that run Android OS. Like the Apple iPad 4, they double as a mobile business device for checking email, browsing the Web, running apps like Evernote, and keeping you on schedule. The downside: They do not use e-Ink, the \"virtual paper\" tech that makes an e-book easier on the eyes.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The second category is what I call a dedicated reader. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.kobo.com\/kobo-aurahd.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc-device&utm_campaign=brand-aurahd-aurahd\">Kobo Aura HD<\/a> ($170) and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ebookstore.sony.com\/reader\/\">Sony Reader<\/a> ($130) do not run on a standard OS like Android, but they do use e-Ink. The screen resolution is technically lower, but e-Ink smoothes the page for easier reading. Technically you can browse the Web and check email, but they tend to run too slow to make those tasks worthwhile.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This debate over screen resolution is incredibly important if you're in the market for a digital reader. The Nook HD+ runs at 1920 x 1280 pixels or 256 PPI (pixels-per-inch)--and the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD has similar specs. Meanwhile, dedicated readers like the Kobo Aura HD run at 1440 x 1080 pixels and 265 DPI (dots per inch). With PPI, you can measure the pixels in a row. With DPI, it's a bit more complicated. The \"dots\" form into a pixel.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">So which is better? There's no contest: The dedicated readers look incredibly sharp. It's more of a decision between multi-purpose readers that you can use for other tasks but are harder on the eyes, or a dedicated reader that makes an e-book page look like real paper.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kindle Fire HD<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">To test them, I started with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Amazon also makes a smaller Fire HD version that has a 7-inch screen and costs only $199, plus several e-Ink models that cost even less. The key feature on the Fire HD 8.9 is a carousel view that automatically puts recent content on the home screen. If you read a book, then check -mail and watch a movie, this activity shows up in the carousel for easier retrieval. The Kindle offers AT&T mobile broadband for only $50 per year. The Fire HD 8.9 weighs 20 ounces and is .35-inches thin. It's fast enough for just about any media you consume.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">After reading two chapters of the book Bunker Hill: A City, a Siege, a Revolution by Nathaniel Philbrick, I felt the screen start to wear on me a bit. The display is crisp, but there's a glowing aura (ahem) from the LCD screen. That's handy for a dark airplane or in a hotel room before bed, and great for HD movies, but not exactly paper-like.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Barnes & Noble Nook HD+<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Next, I tried the Barnes & Noble Nook HD+. (Side note: I'm not a fan of these weird naming conventions. The HD+ name doesn't really say anything other than \"higher price\" to me.) Still, the Nook HD+ is an outstanding multi-purpose reader. The 9-inch screen is colorful and bright, and, at just over 18 ounces, the Nook HD+ is lighter than the Kindle Fire 8.9 but has the same screen size.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">A key feature of the $269 Nook HD+: For those trying to balance work and personal life, you can have profiles for your work account and personal life (and for each family member). Books you want to read on the plane pop up instantly for your work profile, for example. The Nook HD+ lacks the vast ecosystem of Apple or Amazon, though. So, if you're looking to rent a movie and then pop up an app on your Xbox 360 at home to watch it there, you're out of luck.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kobo Aura HD<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, the Kobo Aura HD is an outstanding dedicated reader. I loved reading most of Bunker Hill on this e-reader, and my eyes never felt any strain from the display. I can't say I missed the email and browsing features, either. I tend to use my iPad 4 for that anyway. At 8.4 ounces, the Aura is light enough to take with me on trips, along with a laptop and the iPad. It's ideal for business users who want to read and not be distracted.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The $169.99 Aura HD has the largest e-Ink screen around, at 6.8 inches. The 1GHz processor is fast enough to keep up with book pages, but still not quite up to speed for Web browsing, especially since the e-Ink display tends to flicker quite a bit.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sony Reader<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's one spec I really liked on the Sony Reader, even though it is the least feature-rich of the bunch: the low $129.99 price tag. This e-Ink device does not quite match the screen quality of the Kobo Aura HD, but I still prefer the digital paper tech to the two readers with LCD screens. For a bit of flair, you can get a Reader in stark red to stand out from the crowd. And, the Reader syncs with Evernote for saving notes. Still, the Reader doesn't really win any points with me considering the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B008GEKXUO\/ref=fs_cl\">Kindle Paperwhite<\/a> costs just $119.<\/p><p>And the Winner Is...<\/p><p>So which one gets the final nod? I really liked the profiles on the Nook HD+ and the colorful, crisp screen. The Amazon Kindle Fire 8.9 has a better ecosystem for media. (It's starting to rival even the Apple iPad.) Both are outstanding tablet readers. But for my goal of reading books, I'll keep turning pages on the Kobo Aura HD. I ended up finishing Bunker Hill on that reader and toting it along on a number of business trips. It made the long plane rides and late nights in a hotel more bearable.<\/p>",

I tend to use my iPad 4 for that anyway. At 8.4 ounces, the Aura is light enough to take with me on trips, along with a laptop and the iPad. It's ideal for business users who want to read and not be distracted.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The $169.99 Aura HD has the largest e-Ink screen around, at 6.8 inches. The 1GHz processor is fast enough to keep up with book pages, but still not quite up to speed for Web browsing, especially since the e-Ink display tends to flicker quite a bit.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sony Reader<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's one spec I really liked on the Sony Reader, even though it is the least feature-rich of the bunch: the low $129.99 price tag. This e-Ink device does not quite match the screen quality of the Kobo Aura HD, but I still prefer the digital paper tech to the two readers with LCD screens. For a bit of flair, you can get a Reader in stark red to stand out from the crowd. And, the Reader syncs with Evernote for saving notes. Still, the Reader doesn't really win any points with me considering the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B008GEKXUO\/ref=fs_cl\">Kindle Paperwhite<\/a> costs just $119.<\/p><p>And the Winner Is...<\/p><p>So which one gets the final nod? I really liked the profiles on the Nook HD+ and the colorful, crisp screen. The Amazon Kindle Fire 8.9 has a better ecosystem for media. (It's starting to rival even the Apple iPad.) Both are outstanding tablet readers. But for my goal of reading books, I'll keep turning pages on the Kobo Aura HD. I ended up finishing Bunker Hill on that reader and toting it along on a number of business trips. It made the long plane rides and late nights in a hotel more bearable.<\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/inc\/all-topics\/~4\/Nk2x2_sN69A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/>",

Then when that day arrives, it creates more problems than it solves.<\/p><p>That's what happened to Scott Lerner, founder of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/solixir.com\/\">Solixir<\/a>, a line of all-natural, no-sugar-added energy drinks sold in about 850 stores nationwide, and with annual revenues of about $1 million.

Don't replicate other companies.<\/p><p>It's easy to assume your company should have the same positions as your competitors, or of other organizations you admire. This assumption was a real issue for Lerner, who'd been a PepsiCo executive at one time. \"The mentality was 'Now I can get back to my comfort zone,'\" he says. I compared Solixir to where I was before, and that nice, big org chart. That's where the misstep happened.\"<\/p><p>2. Don't hire until it hurts not to.<\/p><p>When everyone in your company is working evenings and weekends, and there are opportunities you're missing because no one has the time to pursue them--that's the right time to hire. \"Wait till you feel there's an overload of work within the organization,\" Lerner says.<\/p><p>Hiring this way will help you stay attuned to creating positions as they are needed, rather than following a blueprint you've laid out. \"The plan we wrote on paper wasn't what we executed in the market,\" Lerner says. \"We thought we needed a representative in one market, but then realized we needed someone someplace else instead.\" Waiting before you make a hire gives you more time to figure out what help you really need, and where.<\/p><p>3. If you make a mistake, fix it fast.<\/p><p>One of Lerner's regrets is that he didn't eliminate the unneeded positions even more quickly than he did. \"In your gut, you know what's right and wrong, especially as an entrepreneur,\" he says. \"My gut said to make the move a little earlier.\"<\/p><p>He knew for sure it was the right move when eliminating the extra jobs actually made the company stronger. \"There was more work to be done, but it wasn't a negative,\" he says now. Having fewer managers meant some people in the company could take on more responsibility, as well as more work, and it gave them a chance to shine. \"It empowered some people,\" he says.<\/p>",

They are also driving down the margins they make and are offering products that are initially lower functionality than their competitors.<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bothsidesofthetable.com\/2011\/12\/22\/the-amazing-power-of-deflationary-economics-for-startups\/\">I described that phenomenon in this post<\/a>.<\/p><p>Declining prices and margins in a small market  is much less interesting. But as we now know 33 percent of the world's population is now connected to the Internet, the majority of traffic to the major Internet properties is now global and at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BenedictEvans\">Benedict Evans <\/a>pointed out in his recent report, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/bge20\/2013-05-bea\">more than 70 percent of the world's literate population will have a smartphone within four years<\/a>.<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bothsidesofthetable.com\/2013\/06\/09\/heres-whats-driving-collaborative-consumption-and-where-is-the-market-may-head-next\/screen-shot-2013-06-09-at-6-50-00-am\/\"><\/a><\/p><p>Prices down. Network Up. But what else?<\/p><p>The world still has economic challenges that often aren't perceived by many of us in the tech world in our little cocoons of Silicon Valley, NYC or Los Angeles.<\/p><p>Example: More than 50 percent of all youth in Greece and Spain -- 34 percent in Italy -- are unemployed and if you take \"under-employment\" it is even worse. We know the if people miss getting on the career ladder for just three years, it can affect the entire trajectory of their lifetime earning potential.<\/p><p>In the US, that number is 17 percent, which is still too high.<\/p><p>Add unemployment to debt. Student debt alone in the US is now $1 trillion, which $100 billion being added every year.<\/p><p>These types of trends are unsustainable.<\/p><p>I believe that market conditions drive innovation as much as great entrepreneurs do. As they say, \"necessity is the mother of all invention.\"<\/p><p>So those underemployed people who have part time jobs but need more wages will gladly take on five dogs a week in their house on DogVacay.<\/p><p>The person who is between gigs will gladly drive people on Lyft or offer out their spare bedroom on Airbnb.<\/p><p>Consider the case of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tradesy.com\/\">Tradesy<\/a> founder Tracy DiNunzio who <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bothsidesofthetable.com\/2012\/02\/20\/how-this-entrepreneur-raised-28000-using-airbnb-to-fund-her-startup\/\">could only launch her startup by giving up her bedroom for a year and earning $28,000 <\/a>that allowed her to not have a full time job that year.<\/p><p>If your closet is full of clothes and your credit card is full of debt -- of course you're going to trade clothes with other people rather than only buying new stuff.<\/p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0pg9BNfguv8\">You can watch the 20-minute video of my talk if you want here<\/a>.<\/p><p>What are the Types of Collaborative Consumption Companies?<\/p><p>I broke down the types of CC companies into five main buckets today to give a framework to think about your startup if you're entering this space:<\/p><p>1. Tapping into global markets: There are talented people in the world who can't earn a \"global market rate\" for their services but when you open them up to global demand -- boom! An obvious example of this is oDesk. Another is DeviantART, who are able to tap into hundreds of millions of people around the world who produce art and help them making a living. That's why dA has nearly 70 million monthly actives producing 2.5 billion page views making it the largest communities of artists in the world.<\/p><p>2. Empowering the under-employed: I spoke about this briefly already. When you have millions of unemployed youth plus millions more not earning a high-enough wage they are going to find ways to make extra money on the side by running tasks, sitting dogs or reselling their closets. Market meet reality.<\/p><p>One area I didn't talk about in the presentation that really interests me and seems underserved is helping to empower senior citizens. We know that this generation has retired without enough savings. We see our seniors increasingly at Walmart or Starbucks check-out lines. But who is going to put these people back to work part time in their homes and on their phones -- tapping into beautiful brains that don't have the same physical abilities they once did?<\/p><p>3. Moving from hierarchic to flat structures: Some of the peer-to-peer markets are driven where a flat structure is better suited than a top-down model. Here I talked about Lending Club where I understand hedge fund managers are now deploying capital to lend directly against pools of borrowers.<\/p><p>But an equally obvious case is BitCoin where people who live in Iran, Syria or Libya may rather put their money into non-governmental units (even knowing the risks) than to trust their local governmental leaders to protect their assets from inflation or seizure.<\/p><p>4. Breaking down markets requiring physical barriers - I am also very interested in cases where people break down physical barriers that limit wages of instructions while costing too much to students. The obvious cases I mentioned are ones like Udacity but I believe this trend will encapsulate personal trainers, financial planners, depression or substance counsellors, etc. Anywhere where the service provider can earn more at a lower margin by proving more service to the masses.<\/p><p>5. Making existing markets more efficient: There are, of course, markets that have always existed -- like the taxi or limo service markets -- that are simply being made much more efficient through companies like Uber.<\/p><p>Will this Trend Last?<\/p><p>In my mind, there is no doubt this a lifetime trend.<\/p><p>Venture capital will be easy and then hard. The press will romance the topic and then spurn it.<\/p><p>That always happens.<\/p><p>But the key drivers: un\/under-employment, personal and governmental debt, globalization, resource scarcity, transparency and shifting demographics will mean collaborative networks will form throughout our life.<\/p><p>It is the antidote to top-down control.<\/p><p>I also spoke about the trend of open communications from radio to TV to telephon. I believe the natural success to that is Twitter more than any other technology of our generation. It is open and empowering. But with empowerment also comes awareness of what others have that you don't. Which leads to disenfranchisement. And rebellion.<\/p><p>Think Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and now Turkey.<\/p><p>Transparency can breed discontent.<\/p><p>And the solutions to many of the worlds problems will come from the people as much as from governments.<\/p><p>Collaboration. We've only just begun.<\/p><p>How Will it Evolve?<\/p><p>I did spend some time in the presentation to how consumption networks will evolve. It was my sixth trend and one I really believe in. In a world where P2P networks threaten existing business value chains some companies and systems will disppear.<\/p><p>But there are always ones who adapt and thrive. And if you can create a company that can help existing players jujitsu their nimble startups, you'll do well.<\/p><p>One such company is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.deliv.co\/pages\/home\">Deliv<\/a>. They are taking the same approach as an Uber or Lyft -- finding drivers who want to earn a bit more-- and instead of matching them up with consumers they match them up with local retailers to deliver goods to people's homes.<\/p><p>Think about it -- most retailers can't compete with the scale and costs of Amazon.<\/p><p>But they do have a local physical location in your neighborhood.<\/p><p>And what if you could meet the holy grail of same-day delivery for the same cost as overnight on UPS.<\/p><p>That's what Deliv enables. Retailer wins. Driver earns extra income. Consumer gets same-day deliver.<\/p><p>Win.<\/p><p>I suspect you'll see many more companies helping business tap into consumption networks in the years ahead. Companies like this don't capture the sexy headlines in the same way as cars with pink mustaches on them. But they do tend to build large and profitable businesses.<\/p><p>This post originally appeared on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bothsidesofthetable.com\/2013\/06\/09\/heres-whats-driving-collaborative-consumption-and-where-is-the-market-may-head-next\/\">Both Sides of the Table<\/a>. <\/p>",

And if you can create a company that can help existing players jujitsu their nimble startups, you'll do well.<\/p><p>One such company is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.deliv.co\/pages\/home\">Deliv<\/a>. They are taking the same approach as an Uber or Lyft -- finding drivers who want to earn a bit more-- and instead of matching them up with consumers they match them up with local retailers to deliver goods to people's homes.<\/p><p>Think about it -- most retailers can't compete with the scale and costs of Amazon.<\/p><p>But they do have a local physical location in your neighborhood.<\/p><p>And what if you could meet the holy grail of same-day delivery for the same cost as overnight on UPS.<\/p><p>That's what Deliv enables. Retailer wins. Driver earns extra income. Consumer gets same-day deliver.<\/p><p>Win.<\/p><p>I suspect you'll see many more companies helping business tap into consumption networks in the years ahead. Companies like this don't capture the sexy headlines in the same way as cars with pink mustaches on them. But they do tend to build large and profitable businesses.<\/p><p>This post originally appeared on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bothsidesofthetable.com\/2013\/06\/09\/heres-whats-driving-collaborative-consumption-and-where-is-the-market-may-head-next\/\">Both Sides of the Table<\/a>. <\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/inc\/all-topics\/~4\/l9UPYFr95IU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/>",

Here is her shortlist of necessary ingredients for the bootstrapping entrepreneur:<\/p><p>Fire<br \/> Love what you do and all that it makes possible in your life. (Flexibility, financial freedom and lifestyle choices for instance.)<\/p><p>Expertise<br \/> Hone your expertise; be really good at what you do. If you take what you love doing and merge it with what you do well, that's what your business should be about.<\/p><p>Business Model<br \/> Package what you love and are good at into a viable business model and a brand that's appealing to your target market. Market your business effectively. Baroncini-Moe calls this leaning into your marketing. When you lean into your marketing, you tell your target market that you care what they have to say; more importantly, you are willing to act on it.<\/p><p>A Village<br \/> Work hard but work smart! Building a support network will help you do that. Every village needs for groups of people: masterminds, networks, administrators, and advisors. Make lists of people to invite into your village and apply the expertise of others to help your business succeed.<\/p><p>A Clear Head<br \/> Rid yourself of the \"brain junk\" that's likely to thwart your success. Keep a list of the negative thoughts that run through your brain. Now, create the positive equivalent for each thought and practice replacing the negative.

But there are a couple of plans that you do need.<\/p><p>\"First, you need a plan for your life,\" she says. \"What do you want out of life? What matters most to you? It's not just important to know what you want your business to create in your life, it's important to know how much it costs so that you can build your business in a way that you can actually achieve those goals.\" Baroncini-Moe calls this your \"Why Budget\" and offers a \"<a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Business in Blue Jeans\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/businessinbluejeans.com\/\">Why Budget Planner<\/a>\" tool on her website's resources page to help you figure out what your \"dream lifestyle\" costs.<\/p><p>Once you know what kind of income you're working toward, you'll be able to better predict whether a particular business model can sustain that lifestyle. For example, if you wanted to earn seven figures in a service business, you'd probably want to plan to grow into a business model that leverages the time of other people, so that you could have unlimited billable hours, otherwise you'd hit a ceiling in the amount of time you have available and the amount you can charge for your services.<\/p><p>When you're extremely clear on what you're working toward and why it matters to you, then you don't need inspirational sayings or motivational books.  You already have all the motivation you need to get moving.<\/p><p>Second, a marketing plan is a critical component of success. If you don't have a marketing plan, then you'll be chasing strategies and tactics without a clear idea of why you're doing those things. \"It makes much more sense to develop a marketing plan that includes a comprehensive review of the climate of your industry, a clear description of your target market and the competition, and a blueprint for reaching your potential customers,\" says Baroncini-Moe. And remember that a marketing plan shouldn't be a static document, it must be flexible and fluid, evolving as the market changes and your business grows.<\/p>",

If you were to walk past the Tokyo MochiCream storefront with just a glance, you might not immediately guess what it was selling.

I believe that the concept of \"design\" encompasses every aspect of customers's exposure to a brand, from the moment they hear about us to the first time they visit our store to the process of ordering and anticipating the arrival of their glasses. That's why we've created an easy-to-use website and a beautiful Home Try-On box. It's why we've avoided hosting ordinary events in favor of quirky, memorable happenings--like a guerrilla presentation at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week, or a holiday bazaar inside a SoHo garage that we filled with canvas yurts. It's also why we poured so much time and attention into our first bricks-and-mortar store in New York, infusing every detail with references to classic libraries--from brass lamps to custom ladders.<\/p><p>Warby Parker designs experiences, not products. Because we started as an e-commerce venture before expanding to bricks-and-mortar, the lessons I learned from Tokyo's Mochi Cream were especially applicable. The ultimate takeaway: Every moment contains an opportunity to create feelings of satisfaction and excitement in a customer. It's up to retailers to make it happen.<\/p><p> <\/p>",

It's also why we poured so much time and attention into our first bricks-and-mortar store in New York, infusing every detail with references to classic libraries--from brass lamps to custom ladders.<\/p><p>Warby Parker designs experiences, not products. Because we started as an e-commerce venture before expanding to bricks-and-mortar, the lessons I learned from Tokyo's Mochi Cream were especially applicable. The ultimate takeaway: Every moment contains an opportunity to create feelings of satisfaction and excitement in a customer. It's up to retailers to make it happen.<\/p><p> <\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/inc\/all-topics\/~4\/TzJinVy-Dtc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/>",

Here are four powerful lessons taught best by artists.<\/p><p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Strippers-Showgirls-Sharks-Opinionated-Broadway\/dp\/1250018439\/?tag=roarin09-20\">Tony Awards<\/a> for Broadway Theater are Sunday night, showcasing artists across America. As much as people spend money for movies, television, theater and music, why do business experts continue to ignore the incredible leadership teachings that come from the arts?<\/p><p>Several years ago, I published a journal article called <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.taeinternational.com\/Entrepreneurs.pdf\">Entrepreneurs: The Artists of the Business World<\/a>, after discovering through an anecdotal survey that more than 15 percent of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eonetwork.org\">Entrepreneurs' Organization<\/a> membership had arts backgrounds, compared to less than 5 percent who studied business. (As a member and theater arts grad I figured I couldn't be the only one.)  Since this elite organization requires applicants to show $1,000,000-plus revenue, its members must be doing something right. Below are four leadership lessons taught regularly in the arts.<\/p>1. Lead a Project from Start to Finish<p>Many B-school programs culminate study with the writing of business plans that rarely lead to funding or success. Meanwhile, performing arts students must create a concept from scratch, refine it so they can <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Experience-Economy-Theater-Business\/dp\/0875848192\/?tag=roarin09-20\">articulate a compelling vision<\/a>, recruit skilled labor, and manage everyone to completion on time and on budget, since moving opening night is never an option. They also get to sell their product and collect immediate customer response in the form of ticket sales and applause. This process is completed by millions of students several times a year, all over the world.<\/p>2.  Manage Dynamic People Effectively<p>People like to describe artists as eccentric and strange, and many are. So imagine trying to manage an entire company of these weirdos. And yet somehow, unlike your company, these people <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/19FGZrn\">happily<\/a> and consistently deliver highly creative and effective product, even with strict time and resource constraints. And the work they deliver almost always considers a powerful customer experience as the primary objective. Most artists are drilled repeatedly on how to lead their artistic colleagues in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Leadership-Ensemble-Collaborative-Management-Conductorless\/dp\/0805066926\/?tag=roarin09-20\">collaborative manner<\/a> to achieve an effective experience. And despite the frequent presence of professional egos that would crush a Goldman Sachs exec, they learn how to bring all people forward together, or no art would ever be created.<\/p>3. Ensure Total Accountability<p>Let's say you are a stagehand in a simple community production of Hamlet. And you are given the job of placing the skull for the famous Yorick scene. The first time you forget, everyone in the production will chastise you. The second time you will be fired. And you will forever be known as the guy who screwed up the scene, or the violinist who went flat in Beethoven's Ninth, or the dancer who fell in the Nutcracker. Artists live and die by their dependability--yet non-artists consider them flaky and irresponsible! Artists develop in an environment where the production is only as good as its weakest participant. Individual performers with both big and small parts are inherently motivated to bring up the entire company rather than showboating personal performance like the sports players business people love to exalt. Even most stars in the arts know they shine best against a rich and unified background.<\/p>4. Implement Big Picture Thinking<p>From the day you take a role in a production, art project or film, you immediately understand that you are part of something much bigger than yourself. The size of your contribution only matters as far as it contributes to the quality and impact of the whole.  Artists willingly accept this approach as the entire success of output is dependent upon the merit of what they can deliver. Nepotism, longevity and cronyism may provide opportunity, but only true connection with the customer creates longevity. That forces all successful artists to submit their often-large egos to the service of the overall experience. Those who lead others collaboratively to do the same are rewarded with continued opportunity and success. Those who are selfish or stuck in their own vision are doomed to poverty and dissatisfaction.<\/p><p>You can gain these same lessons by <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.artsusa.org\">engaging in the arts<\/a>. Community theater, orchestras, galleries and dance companies are all amazing laboratories for creativity, communication and yes, leadership. People in the arts have these leadership concepts ingrained into them through repetitive, practical application. So if your engineers, sales people and managers are coming up short in these leadership areas, perhaps you should consider hiring a few theater, dance, art or music graduates to show them how it's done.<\/p><p>Like this post?

Here are four powerful lessons taught best by artists.<\/p><p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Strippers-Showgirls-Sharks-Opinionated-Broadway\/dp\/1250018439\/?tag=roarin09-20\">Tony Awards<\/a> for Broadway Theater are Sunday night, showcasing artists across America. As much as people spend money for movies, television, theater and music, why do business experts continue to ignore the incredible leadership teachings that come from the arts?<\/p><p>Several years ago, I published a journal article called <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.taeinternational.com\/Entrepreneurs.pdf\">Entrepreneurs: The Artists of the Business World<\/a>, after discovering through an anecdotal survey that more than 15 percent of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eonetwork.org\">Entrepreneurs' Organization<\/a> membership had arts backgrounds, compared to less than 5 percent who studied business. (As a member and theater arts grad I figured I couldn't be the only one.)  Since this elite organization requires applicants to show $1,000,000-plus revenue, its members must be doing something right. Below are four leadership lessons taught regularly in the arts.<\/p>1. Lead a Project from Start to Finish<p>Many B-school programs culminate study with the writing of business plans that rarely lead to funding or success. Meanwhile, performing arts students must create a concept from scratch, refine it so they can <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Experience-Economy-Theater-Business\/dp\/0875848192\/?tag=roarin09-20\">articulate a compelling vision<\/a>, recruit skilled labor, and manage everyone to completion on time and on budget, since moving opening night is never an option. They also get to sell their product and collect immediate customer response in the form of ticket sales and applause. This process is completed by millions of students several times a year, all over the world.<\/p>2.  Manage Dynamic People Effectively<p>People like to describe artists as eccentric and strange, and many are. So imagine trying to manage an entire company of these weirdos. And yet somehow, unlike your company, these people <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/19FGZrn\">happily<\/a> and consistently deliver highly creative and effective product, even with strict time and resource constraints. And the work they deliver almost always considers a powerful customer experience as the primary objective. Most artists are drilled repeatedly on how to lead their artistic colleagues in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Leadership-Ensemble-Collaborative-Management-Conductorless\/dp\/0805066926\/?tag=roarin09-20\">collaborative manner<\/a> to achieve an effective experience. And despite the frequent presence of professional egos that would crush a Goldman Sachs exec, they learn how to bring all people forward together, or no art would ever be created.<\/p>3. Ensure Total Accountability<p>Let's say you are a stagehand in a simple community production of Hamlet. And you are given the job of placing the skull for the famous Yorick scene. The first time you forget, everyone in the production will chastise you. The second time you will be fired. And you will forever be known as the guy who screwed up the scene, or the violinist who went flat in Beethoven's Ninth, or the dancer who fell in the Nutcracker. Artists live and die by their dependability--yet non-artists consider them flaky and irresponsible! Artists develop in an environment where the production is only as good as its weakest participant. Individual performers with both big and small parts are inherently motivated to bring up the entire company rather than showboating personal performance like the sports players business people love to exalt. Even most stars in the arts know they shine best against a rich and unified background.<\/p>4. Implement Big Picture Thinking<p>From the day you take a role in a production, art project or film, you immediately understand that you are part of something much bigger than yourself. The size of your contribution only matters as far as it contributes to the quality and impact of the whole.  Artists willingly accept this approach as the entire success of output is dependent upon the merit of what they can deliver. Nepotism, longevity and cronyism may provide opportunity, but only true connection with the customer creates longevity. That forces all successful artists to submit their often-large egos to the service of the overall experience. Those who lead others collaboratively to do the same are rewarded with continued opportunity and success. Those who are selfish or stuck in their own vision are doomed to poverty and dissatisfaction.<\/p><p>You can gain these same lessons by <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.artsusa.org\">engaging in the arts<\/a>. Community theater, orchestras, galleries and dance companies are all amazing laboratories for creativity, communication and yes, leadership. People in the arts have these leadership concepts ingrained into them through repetitive, practical application. So if your engineers, sales people and managers are coming up short in these leadership areas, perhaps you should consider hiring a few theater, dance, art or music graduates to show them how it's done.<\/p><p>Like this post?

That is my advice to job hunters,\" says Nick Corcodilos, headhunter extraordinaire, at PBS News Hour. While I've never met Nick, he and I have exchanged numerous emails and he's advised me on my own job hunts, and I respect the heck out of him. In fact, you should <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.asktheheadhunter.com\/subscribe1.htm\">sign up for his newsletter<\/a>.<\/p><p>That said, I politely disagree with his hard-line position. There are some things you should never do when job hunting: answer your cell phone during an interview, get drunk when they take you to lunch or wear your Daisy Duke shorts to any interview that doesn't directly involve pole dancing. Disclosing your salary doesn't make that list.<\/p><p>Nick is right--it should be irrelevant. Companies should make offers based on what you can do for them, not what you did for your previous company. But, most of us don't sit down and calculate what an individual is really worth. We look at what another company thought the candidate was worth and then decide if that salary indicates that you're qualified to go further in the interview process. If your current salary is too low, you're disqualified because you obviously don't have the skills. (Regardless of whether you actually do or not.) And if your current salary is too high, you're disqualified without consideration of whether or not you're interested in that job for reasons other than dollar signs.<\/p><p>In a perfect world, I'd like to see companies be open with what they expect to pay the job and let the candidates self screen. But, the world isn't ideal. Right now, companies have the upper hand and make ridiculous demands--asking for copies of W2s, making people fill out ridiculously long online applications with questions like your <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.askamanager.org\/2013\/06\/ridiculously-detailed-online-job-applications-and-why-they-suck.html\">high school class ranking<\/a>. (And submitting applications through an <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-505125_162-57527660\/how-online-job-searches-worsen-the-job-crisis\/\">online system is about guaranteed not to get you a job<\/a>.)<\/p><p>So, in an ideal world, there'd be no angst around salaries, and no one but your accountant and your spouse would ever need to know your salary history. But, some companies are dumb as rocks when it comes to recruiting. (Of course, do you want to work for a dumb company?)<\/p><p>Then again, salary disclosure is sometimes a good thing. When? When you have a job that you like and it's a good salary and someone approaches you, it's perfectly reasonable to say, \"Well, I'm currently doing X at Company Y and I make $Z. I'd need an increase to $Z+15% to even think about it.\" Now, Nick would argue that you should just say, \"I'm looking for $Z+15%\" to begin with.<\/p><p>But, here's one piece of psychology that he's missing out on: Many, many managers are only going to see you as having value if someone else sees you has having value. It's like toddlers fighting over identical toys. The one someone else has is infinitely better than the one on the shelf. And that's true with job candidates. If your current salary is good, asking for an even better one without the explanation makes you look greedy and somewhat naive about the process. If, however, you can demonstrate that other people think you're awesome and are rewarding you as such? Your chances of a plumb salary just went up.<\/p><p>And, if they choke and suddenly lose interest in you, you know that this isn't a job that was worth your time to seek out. But, this only works if you are already happy in your current role. Why? Because you have the power. If you aren't happy, then they don't need to know your salary because it shouldn't affect their evaluation of you as a candidate. But, the reality is, while Nick would walk away rather than disclose, not all job seekers have the option to do so.<\/p><p>And, therefore, you need to evaluate, do I give up this piece of personal information or do I hold my ground? If you can get to the hiring manager, you're probably golden, but if you're stuck at an HR wall, you'll probably have to confess your salary before you can get through. And business owners: If your HR department is putting up walls, consider replacing them with someone who knows how to value candidates' potential rather than their past.<\/p>",

Companies should make offers based on what you can do for them, not what you did for your previous company. But, most of us don't sit down and calculate what an individual is really worth. We look at what another company thought the candidate was worth and then decide if that salary indicates that you're qualified to go further in the interview process. If your current salary is too low, you're disqualified because you obviously don't have the skills. (Regardless of whether you actually do or not.) And if your current salary is too high, you're disqualified without consideration of whether or not you're interested in that job for reasons other than dollar signs.<\/p><p>In a perfect world, I'd like to see companies be open with what they expect to pay the job and let the candidates self screen. But, the world isn't ideal. Right now, companies have the upper hand and make ridiculous demands--asking for copies of W2s, making people fill out ridiculously long online applications with questions like your <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.askamanager.org\/2013\/06\/ridiculously-detailed-online-job-applications-and-why-they-suck.html\">high school class ranking<\/a>. (And submitting applications through an <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-505125_162-57527660\/how-online-job-searches-worsen-the-job-crisis\/\">online system is about guaranteed not to get you a job<\/a>.)<\/p><p>So, in an ideal world, there'd be no angst around salaries, and no one but your accountant and your spouse would ever need to know your salary history. But, some companies are dumb as rocks when it comes to recruiting. (Of course, do you want to work for a dumb company?)<\/p><p>Then again, salary disclosure is sometimes a good thing. When? When you have a job that you like and it's a good salary and someone approaches you, it's perfectly reasonable to say, \"Well, I'm currently doing X at Company Y and I make $Z. I'd need an increase to $Z+15% to even think about it.\" Now, Nick would argue that you should just say, \"I'm looking for $Z+15%\" to begin with.<\/p><p>But, here's one piece of psychology that he's missing out on: Many, many managers are only going to see you as having value if someone else sees you has having value. It's like toddlers fighting over identical toys. The one someone else has is infinitely better than the one on the shelf. And that's true with job candidates. If your current salary is good, asking for an even better one without the explanation makes you look greedy and somewhat naive about the process. If, however, you can demonstrate that other people think you're awesome and are rewarding you as such? Your chances of a plumb salary just went up.<\/p><p>And, if they choke and suddenly lose interest in you, you know that this isn't a job that was worth your time to seek out. But, this only works if you are already happy in your current role. Why? Because you have the power. If you aren't happy, then they don't need to know your salary because it shouldn't affect their evaluation of you as a candidate. But, the reality is, while Nick would walk away rather than disclose, not all job seekers have the option to do so.<\/p><p>And, therefore, you need to evaluate, do I give up this piece of personal information or do I hold my ground? If you can get to the hiring manager, you're probably golden, but if you're stuck at an HR wall, you'll probably have to confess your salary before you can get through. And business owners: If your HR department is putting up walls, consider replacing them with someone who knows how to value candidates' potential rather than their past.<\/p><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/inc\/all-topics\/~4\/54OyxfP2094\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/>",

I spoke with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.digitalonion.com\/\">project management and productivity expert Tony Wong<\/a> to find out how to transform meetings and increase productivity. Here are his tips:<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. Timing matters.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before you schedule your next meeting, ask yourself this: Do you really need 60 minutes to address the topic at hand? If you allot an entire hour for a meeting, your attendees will likely lengthen the meeting just for the sake of it.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Try <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/wired-success\/201204\/why-meetings-kill-productivity\">reducing the length of your meetings<\/a> to 30 minutes or less--10- and 15-minute meetings may even be all you need. To stay on schedule, always begin at the stated time, regardless of whether everyone has arrived, and end the meeting on time, even if you haven't completed your agenda.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. Keep an eye on the size.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Inviting 10 people is similar to copying 10 people on an email. It's a sign of laziness. The more people you invite to your meeting, the more you sap productivity. Consider meetings VIP events--limit your invitations only to those whom are vital to the topic. As a rule, try for five people or less.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">3. Choose a direction and stick with it.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's nothing more annoying than meeting just to meet. Business meetings aren't effective when a decision needs to be made or for informational purposes. You can take care of that with a simple phone call or a company-wide email with a plea for no reply.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unless it's a brainstorming session, a meeting should be called only to support and convey a previously made decision. A productive business meeting produces a committed plan of action. To stay on track, curb any irrelevant discussions, interruptions, and repeated points.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">4. Define whether you're having a meeting or a work session.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The definition of a traditional business meeting has gotten lost over the years. This is likely how the long-winded meeting with unnecessary tasks came about. People easily confuse business meetings with group work sessions and brainstorming sessions. These two types of work settings require far more time than a standard meeting.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. Ask attendees to come prepared.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This goes beyond putting together a brief agenda. Be sure all people are prepared in advance to work toward a concise plan of action--and have their materials and questions ready prior to entering the door.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">6. Break bad habits.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Your bad habits are likely getting in the way of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052970204642604577215013504567548.html\">a quick and effective meeting<\/a>. Be militant about accomplishing more at your meetings--break notoriously unproductive habits like long introductions and repetitive rambling. Even more challenging: Come to terms with the idea of turning down meetings that aren't vital to you or interrupt your deadlines. If you can't avoid the meeting altogether, set a time limit and leave accordingly.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The traditional business meeting just isn't working. Keep it short, concise, and when possible, eliminate it altogether.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">What do you think? Is the business meeting broken?<\/p>",

As the site Quartz pointed out, these <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/87184\/the-steve-jobs-emails-that-show-how-to-win-a-hard-nosed-negotiation\/\">offer some great insight into how Jobs negotiated<\/a>.<\/p><p>However, Zachary Seward at Quartz called it an example of \"hard-nosed\" negotiation at which Jobs excelled. I'd take a different view. This is not hard-nosed. The emails show how an excellent negotiator used a series of principles to create the best conditions for winning. Let's look in greater detail at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/702951-email-exchange-between-steve-jobs-and-james.html\">exchange between Steve Jobs and James Murdoch<\/a>, son of Rupert Murdoch and the ultimate decision maker, and see how Jobs ultimately got his way.<\/p><p>First, set the stage. Apple and HarperCollins had been discussing bringing the latter's ebooks into the iTunes store for the launch of the iPad. Apple had presented its standard contract. HarperCollins wanted to address the following issues:<\/p><ul><li>flexibility to price on a title-by-title basis outside Apple's pricing tiers<\/li><li>no so-called most favored nation status, so Harper would not have to give Apple as good a deal as any other retailers in case the two companies disagreed on prices and HarperCollins wanted to make titles available through other outlets at higher prices and, potentially, higher income for those retailers<\/li><li>a lower than 30 percent commission on new works<\/li><li>six month windows on using an agency model (publisher sets the price and retailer gets a commission) instead of the 12-month window that Apple wanted<\/li><li>concern that Apple wanted to set prices too high, meaning that competition with Amazon would be difficult<\/li><\/ul><p>And yet, Jobs ultimately prevailed. Here is how.<\/p><p>1. Understand the importance of the negotiation.<\/p><p>According to one of the emails, Steve Jobs got on the phone with Murdoch right away. Jobs was a busy man, but he knew that some deals are critical. To have a credible showing of ebooks, he needed all the major publishers, including HarperCollins. However, there was another aspect of importance that didn't pass him by. If he caved on what he thought he really needed with one publisher, others would eventually find out and push back. Not only was the deal important in and of itself, but also in terms of the effect it could have on other deals.<\/p><p>2. Show that you understand the context and why your proposition is better.<\/p><p>Jobs knew, as did everyone in the publishing industry, that Amazon was driving much of the ebook business. Murdoch verified that Amazon paid $13 wholesale for an ebook title and sold it for $9.99--a loss, but Amazon wanted market share. However, buying high and selling low wouldn't last forever, as Jobs pointed out:<\/p><blockquote><p>The current business model of companies like Amazon distributing ebooks below cost or without making a reasonable profit isn't sustainable for long. As ebooks become a larger business, distributors will need to make at least a small profit, and you will want this too so that they invest in the future of the business with infrastructure, marketing, etc.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Furthermore, Jobs argued that the $9 HarperCollins would get per title was actually sustainable and that the only way to pay more, given that in retail a 30 percent margin is relatively modest, would be to raise prices, angering consumers.<\/p><p>3. Show both kinds of value.<\/p><p>Jobs showed two kinds of value in his email exchange. One was positive value--what HarperCollins would get by working with Apple--and the other was negative, or what HarperCollins would lose by not working with Apple. For example, Jobs wrote that \"Apple is the only other company currently capable of making a serious impact, and we have four of the six big publishers signed up already.\" On one hand, he offers HarperCollins a tool to oppose industry domination by Amazon. On the other, he offers a soft hint that if HarperCollins doesn't play ball, it may get left behind by its major competitors.<\/p><p>4. Lay out the reality.<\/p><p>The Jobs coup de gr&acirc;ce relates to the first point. When Murdoch shows signs of compromise, while trying, as Jobs did, to show positive and negative benefits to Apple, Jobs lays out a stark reality:<\/p><blockquote><p>As I see it, HC has the following choices:<\/p><p>1. Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99 and $14.99.<\/p><p>2. Keep going with Amazon at $9.99. You will make a bit more money in the short term, but in the medium term Amazon will tell you they will be paying you 70% of $9.99. They have shareholders too.<\/p><p>3. Hold back your books from Amazon. Without a way for customers to buy your ebooks, they will steal them. This will be the start of piracy and once started there will be no stopping it. Trust me, I've seen this happen with my own eyes.<\/p><p>Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any other alternatives. Do you?<\/p><\/blockquote><p>At that point, the gloves are off and Jobs shows that HarperCollins, and the wider industry, face a stark choice, and that he, Jobs, knows it and recognizes that giving in to Murdoch would actually mean putting HarperCollins in a medium-term bind.<\/p><p>5. Play the emotion<\/p><p>One of the biggest mistakes that businesspeople make is to assume that the process is a rational and logical one. But negotiation is almost always an emotional play. People make decisions because of ego, fear, greed, a need to please, and so on. Notice that Jobs shows the benefit and the risks by painting pictures and not enumerating lists. For instance, he mentions the 120 million customer credit card numbers on file. He deliberately left the image of all that potential money in Murdoch's mind.<\/p><p>You don't often see an extended example of a negotiation process handled by someone gifted in the field. It is worth reading through the transcript to follow the back and forth and see how skilled Jobs was.<\/p>",

            "description" : "<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/hourglass-in-sand-bkt_13786.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>As income inequality grows, companies that target middle-income consumers face a dwindling customer base.<\/p><p>\"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" This crusty old saying, unfortunately, describes economic trends that are dominating the United States. Some economists call it the \"<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/topics\/business\/future-jobs-hourglass-economy\">hourglass economy<\/a>\"--there are growing numbers of people at the high and low ends of the income spectrum, and fewer and fewer in the middle.<\/p><p>Though hiring a former Apple executive to be a telecommuting CEO was certainly a bonehead move for J.C. Penney, the hourglass economy is the real reason the company is struggling to stay alive, according to Rita Gunther McGrath, associate professor at Columbia Business School, and author of the new book The End of Competitive Advantage. Failure to understand how the economy was changing harmed the retail chain, which traditionally has targeted those shrinking mid-level earners, she says. The hourglass economy can take down your company, too, if you're not careful. That's why McGrath recommends three key tactics.<\/p><p>1. Pick your target market carefully<\/p><p>\"Look at the market in two dimensions,\" McGrath says. \"Are you going after large volumes and a bigger footprint at the low-income end, or will you be a niche player with bigger margins and probably slower growth at the upper end? It's going to be much harder if you try to land in the middle.\"<\/p><p>A company targeting low-income customers needs to be aware of the dynamics that can govern their daily lives, McGrath notes. For instance, many people at the low-income end of the scale live paycheck-to-paycheck, which means that they're only able to make large purchases early in the cycle, right after they've been paid. At the end of the cycle, they can only afford necessities. If you're a retailer, it's smart to stock your shelves in accordance with your customers' pay cycles.<\/p><p>On the other hand, McGrath says, \"If you want to reach people who have more discretionary spending power, be aware that they don't want to buy the same things as all the other people with discretionary spending power.\" Small companies have a natural advantage in this arena, she adds, in that a customer who buys one of your products is unlikely to find that everyone he or she knows has one too.<\/p><p>\"If you're targeting there, think very hard about the emotional component of what you're selling, and how does it set the buyer apart and make that person unique?\" she recommends.<\/p><p>2.

Those without highly marketable skills are left without any guarantee of continued employment, or even of full-time hours from their current employer. \"For people who don't have valuable skills, 'I can replace you with three people tomorrow,' is not an empty threat,\" McGrath says.

Today, those proportions are reversed.<\/p><p>Whatever you do, keep in mind that the hourglass economy isn't going anywhere. \"It's a continuing and growing phenomenon,\" McGrath says. \"We're seeing a shift in power toward owners of capital and away from owners of labor.

            "content:encoded" : "<img src='http:\/\/www.inc.com\/uploaded_files\/image\/100x100\/hourglass-in-sand-bkt_13786.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right:10px;' alt=''><br><p>As income inequality grows, companies that target middle-income consumers face a dwindling customer base.<\/p><p>\"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" This crusty old saying, unfortunately, describes economic trends that are dominating the United States. Some economists call it the \"<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.marketplace.org\/topics\/business\/future-jobs-hourglass-economy\">hourglass economy<\/a>\"--there are growing numbers of people at the high and low ends of the income spectrum, and fewer and fewer in the middle.<\/p><p>Though hiring a former Apple executive to be a telecommuting CEO was certainly a bonehead move for J.C. Penney, the hourglass economy is the real reason the company is struggling to stay alive, according to Rita Gunther McGrath, associate professor at Columbia Business School, and author of the new book The End of Competitive Advantage. Failure to understand how the economy was changing harmed the retail chain, which traditionally has targeted those shrinking mid-level earners, she says. The hourglass economy can take down your company, too, if you're not careful. That's why McGrath recommends three key tactics.<\/p><p>1. Pick your target market carefully<\/p><p>\"Look at the market in two dimensions,\" McGrath says. \"Are you going after large volumes and a bigger footprint at the low-income end, or will you be a niche player with bigger margins and probably slower growth at the upper end? It's going to be much harder if you try to land in the middle.\"<\/p><p>A company targeting low-income customers needs to be aware of the dynamics that can govern their daily lives, McGrath notes. For instance, many people at the low-income end of the scale live paycheck-to-paycheck, which means that they're only able to make large purchases early in the cycle, right after they've been paid. At the end of the cycle, they can only afford necessities. If you're a retailer, it's smart to stock your shelves in accordance with your customers' pay cycles.<\/p><p>On the other hand, McGrath says, \"If you want to reach people who have more discretionary spending power, be aware that they don't want to buy the same things as all the other people with discretionary spending power.\" Small companies have a natural advantage in this arena, she adds, in that a customer who buys one of your products is unlikely to find that everyone he or she knows has one too.<\/p><p>\"If you're targeting there, think very hard about the emotional component of what you're selling, and how does it set the buyer apart and make that person unique?\" she recommends.<\/p><p>2. Don't ignore early signs of trouble. <\/p><p>If you own a small business and have been running it for a while, and you're starting to see a downward trend, take that very seriously, McGrath advises. \"Don't make the mistake of assuming you're seeing a cyclical trend. You hear people say that sales are down but they'll be better next year. It may well be a permanent structural shift, and entrepreneurs often wait too long to ask those questions.\"<\/p><p>3. Stay flexible<\/p><p>In this economy, your best shot at safety is to be able to change your organization on a dime, McGrath says. \"In this hourglass economy, be careful about fixed costs, or fixed commitments to a given business model.

You go on the offensive. Companies in the \"sharing economy\" space are doing just that.<\/p><p>Some of the fastest-growing comanies in Silicon Valley have capitalized on the idea of collaborative consumption and asset sharing. The only problem, of course, is that local regulators around the country don't always have such a breezy view of the sharing economy.
